[Fork project of Mine & Blade Battlegear 2](https://github.com/Mine-and-blade-admin/Battlegear2)
	
Minecraft version: 1.7.10  
Forge Version: 1.7.10-10.13.2.1230

This the second generation of an RPG mod that brings classes with abilities, talent specialization, armor and weapons from World of Warcraft into Minecraft. Our project is based on Mine & Blade Battlegear 2 mod, to involve advanced features such as dual wielding or shield blocking. (Earlier this project was called Battle Classes)

Note: Classes of Warcraft is currently incompatible with the original Mine & Blade Battlegear 2 (we use a modified version of it, packed into our mod), however we are working to on this compatibility issue.
